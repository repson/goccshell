# To-Do:

This course has demonstrated a simple implementation of the core of a shell in Go.

There is plenty of scope to take this project further:

1. Add support for running a historic command, either with the ! syntax or by allowing the use of the up and down arrows and CTRL-R to search through the history. Look into the ncurses library for this.
2. Support variable expansion.
3. Handle scripting.
4. Add handling of job control signals.

Beyond that, pick any feature of your favourite Shell and add it.
